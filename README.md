# dev_primate_resume_app

My resume app is my  responsive portfolio built with flutter using dart language. 
I got my dsesign inspiration from various platfoms including dribble, and watched many youtube tutorials
 if i had more time i would like to patiently add more work experience and recommendations from colleagues
