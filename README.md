# dev_primate_resume_app

My resume app is my  responsive portfolio built with flutter using dart language. This app gives a brief description of my portfolio as mobile developer, it has my profile image wrapped in a circular avatar
I got my dsesign inspiration from various platfoms including dribble, and watched many youtube tutorials
 if i had more time i would like to patiently add more work experience and recommendations from colleagues
 Here is a link to testrun the app  https://appetize.io/app/fffyyp5mbkfsqt5y4bxwjxkgca
